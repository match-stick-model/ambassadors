# Welcome to the ambassadors repo for the matchstickmodel

This is the first page that will tell you about how the ambassador program works. It's going to be an overview and a simple guide. We can create teams so only approved Ambassadors can work here but the work can be transaprent. 

A good example for SLAs or metrics Ambassadors are meant to meet can be included in the projects board. There is a board for each role...

* content creators
* meetups
* moderators
* translators

You will how to apply and about the different roles on this page. This is a page we'll need to write copy for. It's the landing page for ambassadors.
