## Ambassador Roles

01. MODERATORS GET REWARDED

Your community needs you! 
We are looking for all kinds of people with different backgrounds and experiences to help cultivate and nurture the community. Our Moderators are individuals who love people and want to help. We have several official channels, with each delivering information in a different way and some channels are area-specific.

Having moderators in different parts of the world helps the community feel welcomed at all times.

As a Moderator, you will help manage our official community channels and put out the welcome red carpet on Telegram, Facebook, the Forum and Reddit.
 
Tasks: your tasks will include making people feel welcome, removing toxic or unacceptable behavior and keeping discussions constructive. 
Goals: we will provide you with Moderator guidelines including a checklist of performance goals to meet. 
Support: we will provide you with detailed guides on how to perform the tasks you are responsible for. If you flag any knowledge gaps, we will address those promptly. 
Review: we will spot check all channels and any issues will be flagged to Moderators so that we can identify resource or knowledge gaps.

Moderators are eligible to receive rewards. 
Maximum rewards of US$300 are given each month to Moderators who successfully meet the criteria set in the guidelines.
 
You will communicate with other Moderators on a daily basis to discuss tactics, flag behaviours and discuss actions that need to be taken. At the end of the month, Moderators provide a proof of work report with their activity logs from each channel.

02. TRANSLATORS GET REWARDED

Make a global impact. 
Drive Matchstick’s adoption by using your expertise to translate knowledge. In order to grow our library of translated materials, we often rely on the help of volunteers like you – known as Translators. Fluent in their respective languages and with a strong desire to elevate the Matchstick community, our Translators help speed worldwide adoption by sharing newsletters, announcements, guides and documentation in other languages we are yet to support.

Start contributing. 
We invite, in particular, experts fluent in the target languages. Translators that regularly contribute and proactively identify content to translate can apply for Ambassador status. The target languages we are most interested include: French, German, Korean, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish. 

How does it work? 
Community Management Team will recommend pieces, such as the Matchstick newsletter, for translation. 
 
Remember to check the ‘translation’ tag on the forums to see what others are working on. Please use the same tag to inform others what you are planning to work on to avoid duplication. When you have finished, translated pieces should be published in the Matchstick Forum.

Ambassador status makes a Translator eligible to receive rewards. 
Payments are made on a per-word basis of US$0.05/word (¢5 per one word), with a monthly cap of US$300. This equates to 6,000 words after a translation given the necessary paperwork has been handed in. If you want to receive rewards for your work, you will need to submit a Translation Report at the end of every month.

03. MEETUP ORGANIZERS GET REWARDED

Change the world for the better. 
One of the overarching goals of the Matchstick Foundation is to affect change in the real world. And to improve the world we live in, we need you to be an activist and bring people together on the ground. Running a meetup or an event is a form of volunteering you can be incredibly proud of because you are showing leadership. We will support you with toolkits, guides, swag and incentives because we want to see you succeed.

Ambassador status makes a Meetup Organizer eligible to receive sponsorship from their third meetup. 

Non-monetary sponsorship can be requested before your event for swag and merchandise for your attendees. These can be T-shirts, stickers, Tangem cards, etc. The product item and quantity will depend on the size of your groups and the success of your past two events.  
 
Monetary sponsorship can also be requested to cover venue costs or drinks (soft drinks, water, beer) for attendees. You need to submit a budget approval form to be reimbursed. Approval of requests and amount of the sponsorship will be reviewed case-by-case. Please provide your estimate in both your local currency and in US dollars on the day of submission.
 
A baseline incentive of US$20 for a recap report post-event. It should be submitted for the Community Management Team’s review and, subsequently, be posted on the Matchstick Forum. It should include photos and videos from the event to gauge the number of attendees.
 
Extra reward can be provided based on the success of the event. In other words, the higher the number of participants and the better the quality of the recap – the more rewards you can earn.

*After the event, you should submit photo and/or video evidence and attendee feedback forms to the Community Management Team to ensure these non-monetary and monetary sponsorship items were properly handed out.

04. CONTENT CREATORS GET REWARDED

Shift your energy to what you can create.
Your content is vital for driving the adoption of Matchstick because knowledge gaps always exist due to the technical nature and breadth of the project.

Gain access to Matchstick’s audience. 
A creator is someone who is serious about understanding what interests people and educating them with original work. The kind of content you create is entirely up to you, but may include guides, podcasts, articles, forum topics, designs, tutorials, technical writing, infographics or videos.

How does it work? 
Anyone can create content! However, members who want to receive rewards for their work will need to apply to become an Ambassador. To apply, you will submit published pieces through the Ambassador nomination form to allow the Community Management Team to review the type and quality of content to provide useful feedback. Rewards are not automatic and will only be given for content pieces that are deemed of high value for the community and of accurate quality.
 
Each piece of original content will be evaluated on its own merit. 
Content Creators must always publish or link to their content on the Matchstick Forum.
You will want to share and promote your work and link to the forum post to encourage feedback.

Ambassador status makes a Content Creator eligible to receive rewards. 
At the end of the month, Ambassadors will be able to share a report with all the content pieces they published in that month. Links to their content on the Matchstick Forum and original links (i.e. from YouTube or Medium) will need to be included. Content pieces that are accepted will receive a flat rate of US$20 with a monthly cap of US$300. Pieces that required more time and effort or received an overwhelmingly positive response from the community may be subject to greater reward at our discretion.
