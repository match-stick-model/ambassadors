# Welcome to the ambassadors repo for the matchstickmodel

This is the first page that will tell you about how the ambassador program works. It's going to be an overview and a simple guide. You will be told how to submit ideas, how to monitor the stages of proposals by looking at the 'projects' in the top tab.

We'll explain how to submit a suggestion through the 'issues' tab, how to keep track of where funding is being awarded and the milestones that projects have met.

This is a page we'll need to write copy for. It's the landing page for funding.
